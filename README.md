# Diabetes-Prediction-and-its-symptom-analysis-with-machine-learning-approach

Diabetes is a common problem in different ages people and those people who not only suffering diabetes but also, they have suffered from other symptoms which affect their health. However, to get a good recognition process we need a large amount of data which may be sufficient to generate good results. It is difficult to collect that amount of data from any health care service. On the other hand, we can use an online existing dataset to establish a proper system to get a better process for Diabetes problems. There are numerous ML algorithms and used for several reasons for examination and prediction. This work shows, how this disease gives better accuracy from the exit classification algorithms. Classification algorithms like SVM, KNN, Random Forest and Na√Øve Bayes algorithms execute their better performance based on the dataset. Until now there are three types of diabetes which are Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3. We generate accuracy and predict those types by distributing our whole dataset according to the age of the patients. Some algorithms are implemented on the types to find out accuracy. In diabetes prediction, the Random Forest algorithm gives better accuracy than another algorithm that is 80%.
